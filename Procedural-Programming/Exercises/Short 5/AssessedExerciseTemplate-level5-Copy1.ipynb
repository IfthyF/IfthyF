This is a final variable so it stays constant as this is the number of women footballers we will give deatils for. Then we declare and intialise each array with the size of variable players for all. So the array player_names (String type) will hold the 4 female footballers names. The array goals (integer type) will hold the goals scored of each footballer. Then the player_country array (String type) will hold the countries the footballers play for. Then a for loop is used to ask the questions of the footballers name, number of goals scored and what country they played for and get the user's responses. This is done using inputString and inputInt methods. Then each of the details are held in the corresponding array. This is repeated 4 times (as counter ends at value of players which is teh size of the arrays) for each footballer and their details so they are stored in each index of the array. Then we get the highest scoring footballer by getting the index of the highest value of array goals using method index and arguments goals and players. Then the index value that contains the highest value in array goals is stored in high_value. Then the highest scorer name is printed out by concatenating the array player_name value of high_value index. This will give the footballer's name of the highest scorer as the arrays are stored with their corresponding index of each player's details. Then to get the total sum of all the goals scored of all 4 footballers we call method total and give arguments goals and players. This will get a full total of the goals scored by the footballers. It is then stored in variable total_score (integer type). Then the total sum of goals scored by all footballers is printed through concatenation of variable total_score.\n",
