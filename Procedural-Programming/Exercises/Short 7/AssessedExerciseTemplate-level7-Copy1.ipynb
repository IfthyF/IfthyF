For each method, I will explain about the method, what is does and how I tested it and provide the code of the method itself. Next, I show how to run the solution to the question. Each code fragment can be run in Jupyter notebooks, here. Finally, I show the full program that can only be run outside of notebooks, along with instructions on how to do this and a summary of the structure of the full program."

Then asks the user what country a relay team represents and allows a String response from the user using inputString method call and stores the response in variable teamCountry. Then it asks the user what is the disability category for each of the 4 swimmers seperately and gets a response from the user using inputInt method call. Then stores each of the categories of the swimmer (from the response) to the corresponding variables. So the first swimmer category is stored in variable category_1 and so on. Then the record of the relay team details is created by calling out the initialisation method with corresponding variables of teamCountry, category_1, category_2, category_3 and category_4 as arguments which creates and initilaises the record. Then an if statement is used to print out if the team is legal or not depending on their total points. So the test asks if the total points value (gotten from calling accessor method getTotal) is less than or equal to value of classification (value of maximum legal points). If this test is true it will print out that the team is legal using concatenation of accessor methods to get total points and the country the team represent. Otherwise if the test is false it will print out that the team is not legal using concatenation of accessor methods to get total points and the country the the team represents."
