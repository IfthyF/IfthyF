    "Write a program that is to be used to count how many passengers are travelling on buses that pass a particular bus stop in a given hour. It should use a while loop to repeatedly ask the user to give the number of passengers on the bus that just passed. It should stop when the special code X is entered as the number of passengers. It should then give the number of buses and the total number of passengers counted in that hour. \n",

For each method, I will explain about the method, what is does and how I tested it and provide the code of the method itself. Next, I show how to run the solution to the question. Each code fragment can be run in Jupyter notebooks, here. Finally, I show the full program that can only be run outside of notebooks, along with instructions on how to do this and a summary of the structure of the full program."

    "#### What it does\n",
    "This method asks the user repeatedly to give the number of passengers on the bus that just passed. The user should then give a number response. The loop stops when a special character \"X\" is entered as the number of passengers. It then gives the number of buses and total number of passengers counted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation (how it works)\n",
    "In the first line passengers variable (String type) is declared and intialised with letter \"A\" which will be used later on in the method. Then the variable busCounter1 (integer type) is declared and initialised which will be used as a counter in the while loop after to count how many buses are counted. The variable totalPassengers (also an integer type) is declared and intialised which will keep record of how many passengers accumulate in the loop. Variable busCounter2 is declared to be used further in the code. In the while loop the test is while the passengers value is not equal to the special code (X). So when the question of how many passengers were on the bus is repeated to the user, if their response (which is stored in variable passengers) is X it will stop the loop. The question is repeated in the body of the while loop using inputString to get the user's response and store it in passengers variable. Each time the loop repeats the busCounter1 variable increases by 1 until the passengers value is equal to the special code. This is done to keep record of the total buses that have passed. Since the passengers variable is a String type, when the user enters a number as a response to the question we have to change the value to an integer. This is done through an if statement when the passengers value (response to the question) is not the special code X. So this becomes the test of the if statement. So if the if statement test is true (response to question is a number and stored in passengers) then totalPassengers gets the copy of the previous totalPassengers value add the number of the passenger variable. The number in the passenger variable is changed from String to integer using Integer.parseInt of passenger variable so we can add to totalPassengers. This is repeated again in the while loop through the if statement which accumlates the number of passengers. This gives a total of the passengers once the while loop stops (when special code is entered). After the loop busCounter2 gets a copy of busCounter1 value subtracted by 1. This is done to not count the last repeat of the loop. Then it prints the total passengers and total buses passed."
