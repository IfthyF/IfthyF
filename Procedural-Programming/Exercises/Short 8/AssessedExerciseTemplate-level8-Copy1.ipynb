For each method, I will explain about the method, what is does and how I tested it and provide the code of the method itself. Next, I show how to run the solution to the question. Each code fragment can be run in Jupyter notebooks, here. Finally, I show the full program that can only be run outside of notebooks, along with instructions on how to do this and a summary of the structure of the full program."

First it sets up a local scanner to the method, linked to the keyboard. This makes avaliable the method scanner.nextLine(). Then a local record is created called textRecord of the type CharacterStream. Then the message is printed out to the user. Then scanner.nextLine allows the user to enter a response (taking a whole string up until the user hits enter) and this is read and put in record textRecord in the inputToParse field. Then position field of that record is set to 0 as it is the front of the character sequence of the expression given. Then it returns that record as a result of the method."

This record data is passed through via argument when calling this method. Then answer variable is declared as integer. The variable next_character of type char holds the next character of the text to parse (from record text) which is the first character. The position is unchanged. This is done by calling the method CheckNextCharacter. Then it uses if-then-else statements to test the value in variable next_character. So the first test asks if the value in next_character is equal to the addition symbol and if this is true then it reads past the addition symbol by calling method readPastNextCharacter and then gets the next character which is a digit and gets the integer of it and stores it in variable dig. This is done by calling method evalDIGITS. Then it gets the next character which is an expression and gets the integer value of that expression and stores it into variable exp. This is a recursive problem done by doing recursion by calling the evalEXP method (in the same method). Then the two values in variables dig and exp are added together and the result is stored in variable answer. The second test asks if the value in variable next_character is equal to the subtraction symbol and if this is true then it reads past the subtraction symbol by calling method readPastNextCharacter. Then it get the next character which is a digit and gets the integer of it and stores it in variable dig. This is done by calling method evalDIGITS. Then it gets the next character which is an expression and gets the integer value of that expression and stores it into variable exp. This is a recursive problem which is solved by doing recursion by calling the evalEXP method (in the same method). The two values in variables dig and exp are subtracted and the result is stored in variable answer. The third test asks if the value in the variable next_character is equal to the & symbol (which means calculate the sum up to the given number). If this is true then it reads past the & symbol in the inputted expression by calling method readPastNextCharacter. Then it get the next character which is an expression and gets the integer value of it and stores it in variable exp. This is a recursive problem solved by doing recursion which involves calling method evalEXP (in the same method). Then is gets the answer by doing the calulation up to that given number (value in variable exp) which involves a formula to do it. It then stores the answer from the calculation in variable answer. Otherwise, if all the test are false in this if-then-else staircase it then gets the next character which is a digit (as the next character cannot be a symbol) and gets the integer value of it and stores it into answer variable. At the end it returns the value in answer as a result of this method."
