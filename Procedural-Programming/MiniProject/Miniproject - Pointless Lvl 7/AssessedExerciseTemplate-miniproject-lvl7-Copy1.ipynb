    "Write a short answer quiz procedural program where the player gets points based on the number of members of the public (out of 100 people asked) who gave that answer (for the purposes of testing you can make up the response numbers). The aim is to choose an answer that as few people as possible thought of so gain as FEW points as possible (eg Name UK olympic track and field gold medal winners. ... Suppose 78 people named Dina Asher-Smith, 42 named Sebastian Coe, and 2 named Fatima Whitbread, then an answer of FatimaWhitbread gains 2 points and is the best answer. Wrong answers gain 100 points.)\n",

For each method, I will explain about the method, what is does and how I tested it and provide the code of the method itself. Next, I show how to run the solution to the question. Each code fragment can be run in Jupyter notebooks, here. Finally, I show the full program that can only be run outside of notebooks, along with instructions on how to do this and a summary of the structure of the full program."

We then print out the message variable that the programmer writes when calling the method as an argument in the brackets. Then in the next line nextLine() allows the user to enter the answer where it reads the answer and stores it in variable answer. Then at the end of the method we return the answer variable and the input data held in it. Note that you have to import scanner in the full program."

Then question1 is defined and intialised to get string value called \"actors.txt\". This is the file name used to create a text file with that name. Then to write to that file the code creates an output stream targeted at that file. This is done in the second line of the method. This creates the text file called actors.txt and creates an output stream connecting variable outputStream with the file called actors.txt. FileWriter here links it to a FileWriter object in the program, so the program can write to it. This makes outputStream.println() and outputStream.close avaliable. Then to write to it the code uses outputStream.println() method with the string you want to write as the argument. So this code prints the question in the first line and then the answers and their points each line after to the text file. Then the file is closed using outputStream.close() method. Finally as a result we return the file name string value which is stored in variable question1 so we can hold on to it so we can read the file later."

Then the first line allows the text file of file name of whatever value is in variable question_file to be read. This creates an input stream connected to the file called whatever the value in variable question_file. It links variable inputStream to the file so that FileReader can get the characters from the file and BufferedReader putting the characters back into Strings (it buffers the data) until it is ready to be taken via the variable inputStream. To read a line of text from the file you use inputStream.readLine method and in the first line contains the  question which is stored as a string value in variable question. Then the second and third line contains the answer and the points of that answer and that is read using inputStream.readLine method and stored in string type variable answer1 and integer type variable score1. Using inputStream.readLine method produces a string value to store the score in score1 variable as an integer type we use Integer.parseInt to convert the string value into an integer value. This is done for fourth and fifth lines of the text file for variables answer2 and score2 and then sixth and seventh lines of the text file for variables answer3 and score3. To then close the file to stop reading we then use inputStream.close() method. We then create a record of type QuizQuestion which holds the question, answers and their corresponding points or score using method createQuestion and the arguments which are the question variable holding the question string value, answer1 and score1 variables holding their answer string value and score integer value and so on. As a result we then return the question record created holding the data."

    "This method is the method doing all the work. It asks the user how many people want to do the quiz and then lets each user do the quiz and allows each user to answer another question if they like (each time they have finished answering a question) and then tallys up and records the each users scores and print the scores and prints a leaderboard if the user wants to see it. Then the program is exited.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implementation (how it works)\n",
    "Note that this method needs throws IOExeception as it handles file IO. Firstly this method creates the question bank by calling the method createBank (which involves file IO) and then stores it into an array of type QuizQuestion called Quiz_questions. This variable Quiz_questions is a final variable as it stays constant throughout the code. Then it asks the user how many people want to do the quiz and gets their response. This is done by calling method inputInt with the question as the argument and then stores the response in variable number_of_times (which is of type integer). This is a final variable since it stays constant throughout the code. Then we create two new arrays, one is called board which is of type integer which will hold the final scores of each user in order to create a leaderboard. The other array is called playerScores which is string type and will hold the scores of each user in order to print out all the user's and their scores. The size of both arrays is the value in final variable number_of_times (which is the number of people doing the quiz) since the number of scores is the number of people doing the quiz. Then a for loop is used to repeatedly do the quiz for each user particpating in the quiz. Then a blank line is printed to seperate what is printed next. Then it will print to the user doing the quiz saying the first person to answer the question from the question bank through concatenation of variable user_name which holds the string value of which person doing the quiz. Then two totals are declared and intialised which are total and total2 which are both integer type and hold value 0. Variable total is used to hold the score the user get from each question they answer and variable total2 will keep a running total of what score they get overall. Then a while loop is used to repeatedly ask the user what question they want to answer and allow them to answer the question they chose and get the score from their answer. This is done by calling method printQuestion with the question bank variable Quiz_questions as the argument. This will then return the score they get from answering that question and store it in variable total. Then it increments total2 by the value in total. Then it ask the user if they want to answer another question with a response of Y or N. This is done by calling inputString with the question as the argument. This response is stored in variable tries. If the user does have a response of Y then it will repeat the loop since the test is true as tries will equal to Y. If the response is N stored in variable tries then it will exit the while loop and then create a record of the score and name of that user who just done the quiz by calling createScore and store it into record player of ADT TotalScore. Then it adds the record data (which contains score and name of the user) to a string array playerScores at position i. Then adds the value of total2 (which is the final score that user got) to array board at position i. Then creates a blank line to again seperate it. This body of the for loop is repeated for the next user to answer the quiz and so on until the value of number_of_times. Then it prints the each value of array playerScores to show the final scores each user got by calling printScores method with array playerScores as the argument. Then it asks the user if they want to see the leaderboard or not. If not it prints a message and exits the program and if they say yes it sorts the array board with the final scores of each user. This is done by calling createTableScore method with array board as the argument. Then it prints the leaderboard with the ranked positions (from least points to highest) by calling method printTableScore with array board as the argument. Then the method returns to the main method."
